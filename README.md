### LOTR ASCII Adventure Game with Java & GPT

Welcome to the ASCII adventure game set in the world of Lord of the Rings! 🧝‍♂️🌋🗡️

This project is a text-based adventure game where players can immerse themselves in the world of Lord of the Rings and make decisions that will affect the course of their journey. The game's storyline is generated by GPT, a natural language processing AI, which means each gameplay experience can be unique. 🎮📜

 

#### ⚠️ Important Note
Game texts and prompts are in Spanish. Feel free to change them if you want to. 🌍️

For the story to be generated by GPT, ensure that the OpenAI API is correctly configured in the project. You can find the relevant configuration in `com.guuri11.lotrascii.helpers.Network.NetworkManager#sendToGPT`. If you don't have access to the OpenAI API, you can modify this part of the code to suit your needs or simply skip the text generation and define your own storyline.
